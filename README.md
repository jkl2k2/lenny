## **Lenny**
### >> A multipurpose (but music-focused) Discord bot utilizing discord.js and Node.js
##### This project is a hobby of mine that I've been working on since about freshman year of high school. Its name stems from a friend's joke about creating a bot whose sole purpose is to create Lenny faces on demand. Obviously, it has since evolved into much more, serving as the music bot for my friends' Discord servers.

##### *This bot isn't necessarily designed to be downloaded and started by people other than me. This repo is public mostly just for the sake of being open-source.*
